# 💊 Medicine Recommendation & E-Pharmacy System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that recommends medicines based on user-entered symptoms, while also considering **maintenance medicines** and **allergies**.  

It combines:  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **NLTK** and **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** to match symptoms to possible medications.  
- A small **e-commerce pharmacy system** with a shopping cart, payment simulation, and admin panel to manage medicines.  

Users can:  
- Enter symptoms and get recommended medicines with alternatives.  
- Shop medicines and manage their cart.  
- Pay (simulated payment) for items in the cart.  
- Admins can add, update, or delete medicines from the database.
